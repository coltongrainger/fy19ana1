### Open balls in metric spaces

Let $(X, \rho)$ be a metric space. We will show that balls in the metric space are open.

Take an arbitrary point in the space $x \in X$ and a radius $\eps > 0$. I claim $$\ball{\rho}{\eps,x} := \left\{ a \in X : \rho(a,x) < \eps \right\}$$ is open in $X$. 

Indeed, take a point $a \in \ball{\rho}{\eps,x}$ (note that $\rho(a,x) < \eps$). Now consider the radius $\delta = \eps - \rho(x,a) > 0$. We need to show the open ball $\ball{\rho}{\delta, a}$ containing the point $a$, is nested in within a radius $\eps$ of $x$, i.e., we need to show $\ball{\rho}{\delta, a} \subset \ball{\rho}{\eps, x}$. Well, if $b \in \ball{\rho}{\delta, a}$, then $\rho(a,b) < \delta = \eps - \rho(x,a)$, with the triangle inequality we have $\rho(b,x) \leq \rho(a,b) + \rho(x,a) < \eps$, hence $b \in \ball{\rho}{\eps, x}$. 

So for every point $a$ in the open ball $\ball{\rho}{\eps,x}$ there's a nested open ball $\ball{\rho}{\delta, a}$ such that $a \in \ball{\rho}{\delta,a} \subset \ball{\rho}{\eps,x}$. By definition, $\ball{\rho}{\eps,x}$ is open.

### New metric spaces from old

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Define $\rho \colon X \times X \to [0,\infty)$ by $$\rho(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}.$$ We'll show that $\rho$ is a metric on $X$.

*Key idea.* We have some transformation $f: [0,\infty) \to  f: [0,\infty)$ of the metric $d$ given by $f(k) = \frac{k}{1+k}$. Now $f$ is strictly monotone, so order preserving, and concave downwards, so subadditive. We'll make repeated use of the property that $$\text{ if } c, k \in [0,\infty) \text{ and } c \leq k, \text{ we have } c(1+k) = c+ck \leq k +ck = k(1+c) \text{ whence } \frac{c}{1+c} \leq \frac{k}{1+k}.$$ We have equality iff $c=k$.

Now to show that $\rho$ is a metric, take three arbitrary points $x,y,z \in X$.

- We have $y=x$ iff $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $\pho(x,y) = 0$, since for the metric transformation defined above $f(d(x,y)) = \pho(x,y)$ and $f(0) = 0$ and $f^{-1}(0) = 0$.
- Symmetry of $\pho$ is clear from the symmetry of $d$.
- To verify the triangle inequality holds in the metric space $(X, \pho)$, we need to show
  $$\frac{d(y,x)}{1+d(y,x)} + \frac{d(z,y)}{1+d(z,y)} \geq \frac{d(z,x)}{1+d(z,x)}.$$
  So let $a = d(y,x)$, $b = d(z,y)$ and $c = d(z,x)$ and note $a,b,c \in [0,\infty)$. Since the triangle inequality holds in the space $(X,d)$,  we have $a + b \geq c$. So consider $k = a+b$. It follows that $c \leq k$ and thus $\frac{c}{1+c} \leq \frac{k}{1+k}$. That is, $\frac{c}{1+c} \leq \frac{a+b}{1+a+b}$ hence $$\frac{c}{1+c} \leq \frac{a+b}{1+a+b} = \frac{a}{1+a+b} = \frac{b}{1+a+b} \leq {4$$
(a) Now, for any point $x \in X$ and radius $r > 0$, $$\ball{d}{r,x} = \ball{\rho}{\frac{r}{1+r}, x}.$$

(b) Further, if $G$ is an $(X,d)$-open set, then $G$ is also $(X,\rho)$-open.

### An algebra of sets

Let $X$ be an uncountable set. Consider the union $$\sA = \{U \subset X : U \text{ is finite}\} \cup \{V \subset X : X\setminus V \text{ is finite}\}.$$

(a) We'll show that $\sA$ is an algebra of sets of $X$.

(b) Further, we'll determine whether of not $\sA$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$. We also describe the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\sA$.

### Rings and $\sigma$-rings [@Fo99, number 1.1]

A family of sets $\sR \subset \sP(X)$ is called a ring if it is closed under finite unions and differences; a ring that is closed under countable unions is called a $\sigma$-ring.

### The Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\RR$ [@Fo99, number 1.2]

We'll demonstrate that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\sB_\RR$ is generated by the following collections of intervals in $\RR$.

### Infinite $\sigma$-algebras [@Fo99, number 1.3]

Let $\sM$ be an infinite $\sigma$-algebra. Then:

(a) $\sM$ contains an infinite sequence of disjoint nonempty sets.

(b) $\card{\sM} \geq \mathfrak{c}$.

### Closure under countable increasing unions [@Fo99, number 1.4]

An algebra $\sA$ is an $\sigma$-algebra iff $\sA$ is closed under countable increasing unions.
That is, $$\text{if } \{E_j\}_1^\infty \subset \sA \text{ and } E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \cdots, \text{ then } \cup_1^\infty \in \sA.$$

### Linear combinations of measures [@Fo99, number 1.7]

If $\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n$ are measures on $(X, \sM)$ and $a_1, \ldots,a_n \in [0,\infty)$, then $\sum_1^n a_j \mu_j$ is a measure on $(X,\mu)$.

### Summing sets by union and intersection [@Fo99, number 1.9]

If $(X, \sM, \mu)$ is a measure space and $E, F \in \sM$, then $$\mu(E) + \mu(F) = \mu(E\cup F) + \mu(E\cap F).$$

### A measure relative to set intersection [@Fo99, number 1.10]

If $(X, \sM, \mu)$ is a measure space and $E \in \sM$, define $$\mu_E(A) = \mu(A \cap E) \text{ for all } A \in \sM.$$
Then $\mu_E$ is a measure.
