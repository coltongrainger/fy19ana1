### Open balls in metric spaces

Let $(X, \rho)$ be a metric space. 
Now suppose $a \in X$ and $\eps > 0$. 
We'll show that $$\ball{\rho}{\eps,a} := \left\{ x \in X : \rho(x,a) < \eps \right\}$$ is open in $X$.

### New metric spaces from old

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. 
Define $\rho \colon X \times X \to [0,\infty)$ by $$\rho(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}.$$ 
We'll show that $\rho$ is a metric on $X$.

(a) Now, for any point $x \in X$ and radius $r > 0$, $$\ball{d}{r,x} = \ball{\rho}{\frac{r}{1+r}, x}.$$

(b) Further, if $G$ is an $(X,d)$-open set, then $G$ is also $(X,\rho)$-open.

### An algebra of sets

Let $X$ be an uncountable set. Consider the union $$\sA = \{U \subset X : U \text{ is finite}\} \cup \{V \subset X : X\setminus V \text{ is finite}\}.$$

(a) We'll show that $\sA$ is an algebra of sets of $X$.

(b) Further, we'll determine whether of not $\sA$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$. We also describe the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\sA$.

### Rings and $\sigma$-rings [@Fo99, number 1.1]

A family of sets $\sR \subset \sP(X)$ is called a ring if it is closed under finite unions and differences; a ring that is closed under countable unions is called a $\sigma$-ring.

### The Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\RR$ [@Fo99, number 1.2]

We'll demonstrate that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\sB_\RR$ is generated by the following collections of intervals in $\RR$.

### Infinite $\sigma$-algebras [@Fo99, number 1.3]

Let $\sM$ be an infinite $\sigma$-algebra. Then:

(a) $\sM$ contains an infinite sequence of disjoint nonempty sets.

(b) $\card{\sM} \geq \mathfrak{c}$.

### Closure under countable increasing unions [@Fo99, number 1.4]

An algebra $\sA$ is an $\sigma$-algebra iff $\sA$ is closed under countable increasing unions.
That is, $$\text{if } \{E_j\}_1^\infty \subset \sA \text{ and } E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \cdots, \text{ then } \cup_1^\infty \in \sA.$$

### Linear combinations of measures [@Fo99, number 1.7]

If $\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n$ are measures on $(X, \sM)$ and $a_1, \ldots,a_n \in [0,\infty)$, then $\sum_1^n a_j \mu_j$ is a measure on $(X,\mu)$.

### Summing sets by union and intersection [@Fo99, number 1.9]

If $(X, \sM, \mu)$ is a measure space and $E, F \in \sM$, then $$\mu(E) + \mu(F) = \mu(E\cup F) + \mu(E\cap F).$$

### A measure relative to set intersection [@Fo99, number 1.10]

If $(X, \sM, \mu)$ is a measure space and $E \in \sM$, define $$\mu_E(A) = \mu(A \cap E) \text{ for all } A \in \sM.$$
Then $\mu_E$ is a measure.
