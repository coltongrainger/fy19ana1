### Finite coverings of a measure space

Let $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite sequence of measurable subsets of the measure space $(X, \sM, \mu)$, where $\mu(X) = 1$. If each point of $X$ belongs to at least three of these sets, then at least one of the $E_i$ has measure greater than or equal to $\frac3n$.

*Proof.* Partition $X$ by taking the minimal elements in the finite algebra $\sA$ generated by the $E_i$ in $X$ (partially ordered by set inclusion). Let the finite collection of such minimal elements be $\sC$. For each $C_j \in \sC$, we observe that $C_j \in \sM$. Furthermore, $\sC$ partitions $X$ because (i) the $E_i$ cover $X$ and (ii) if two blocks $C_j$ and  $C_k$ in $\sC$ did intersect, these blocks would not minimal elements in $\sA$, a contradiction. We conclude that every point in $X$ belongs to exactly one of finitely many $C_j \in \sC$.

For notation's sake, let $C_j^i = E_i \cap C_j$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$ and all $j$. Now every point in $X$ is, by hypothesis, contained in at least three of the $E_i$, whence also contained in at least three of the $C_j^i$. There are thus at least three values of $j$ for which $\{C_j^i\}_{i=1}^n$ is a partition of $X$. With $\mu(X) = 1$, finite additivity implies

$$\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{\forall j} \mu(C_j^i) \geq 3\mu(X) = 3.$$

But by construction $E_i = \sqcup_{\forall j} C_j^i$. Hence, by finite additivity, 
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \mu(E_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{\forall j} \mu(C_j^i).$$

We conclude that $\sum_{i=1}^n \mu(E_i) \geq 3$, so there's a $E_i$ with $\mu(E_i) \ge \frac{3}{n}.$ \qedsymbol

### Equivalence relations on a finite space [@Fo99, number 2.12]

Let $(X, \sM, \mu)$ be a finite measure space.

(a) If $E, F \in \sM$ and $\mu(E\triangle F)=0$, then $\mu(E) = \mu(F)$.
(b) Say that $E \sim F$ iff $\mu(E \triangle F) = 0$: then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\sM$.
(c) If $E, F \in \sM$, define $\rho(E,F) = \mu(E \triangle F)$. Then $\rho(E,G)\le \rho(E,F) + \rho(F,G)$ for all $E,F,G \in \sM$, and hence $\rho$ defines a metric on the quotient space $\sM/\sim$.

*Proof.* Let $E, F$ be measurable sets, and suppose that $\mu(E\triangle F) = 0$. Since $$E \triangle F = (E \setminus F) \sqcup (F \setminus E)$$ from additivity we have $0 = \mu(E\triangle F) = \mu(E \setminus F) +  \mu(F \setminus E)$. Now $\mu$ maps into $[0,\infty]$, so both $\mu(E \setminus F) = \mu(F \setminus E) = 0$. Break into disjoint sets $E = (E \setminus F) \sqcup (E \cap F)$ and $F = (F \setminus E) \sqcup (F \cap E)$, so that, again by additivity, we prove (a)
\begin{align*}
\mu(E) &= \mu(E \setminus F) + \mu(E \cap F)\\
    &= \mu(E \cap F) + \mu(F \setminus F)\\
    &= \mu(F).
\end{align*}

For the relation defined on $\sM$ by $E \sim F$ iff $\mu(E \triangle F) = 0$,

- $E \sim E$ as $E \triangle E = \emptyset$ is a null set under $\mu$,
- $E \sim F$ implies $F \sim E$ as $E \triangle F = F \triangle E$,
- $E \sim F$ and $F \sim G$ implies $E \sim G$ as 
    $$E \triangle G 
    = (E \triangle F)\triangle(F \triangle G) 
    = [(E \triangle F) \setminus (F \triangle G)] \sqcup [ (F \triangle G) \setminus (E \triangle F) ]$$ 
  and when $\mu(E \triangle F) = \mu(F \triangle G) = 0$, we have (by monotonicity) $$\mu(E \triangle G) = \mu[(E \triangle F) \setminus (F \triangle G)] + \mu[ (F \triangle G) \setminus (E \triangle F)] \le \mu(E \triangle F) + \mu(F \triangle G) = 0.$$

Let $\bar{\sM}$ be the set of equivalence classes in $\sM$ by the relation $\sim$. To show the function $\rho \colon \bar{\sM} \times \bar{\sM} \to [0,\infty]$ defined by $\rho(\bar{E}, \bar{F}) = \mu(E \triangle F)$ is a metric, consider the equivalence classes of any three measurable sets $E$, $F$, and $G$. Because $\rho$ is defined on $\bar{\sM}$, we know $\rho(\bar{E}, \bar{F}) = 0$ iff $\mu(E \triangle F) = 0$ iff $\bar{E} = \bar{F}$. Because the binary operator $\triangle$ is symmetric, $\rho$ is symmetric. The triangle inequality on $\rho$ follows from $\mu(E \triangle G) \leq \mu(E \triangle F) + \mu(F \triangle G)$. Therefore $\rho$ is a metric on $\bar{\sM}$.

### Large sets in semifinite measures [@Fo99, number 2.14] 

If $\mu$ is a semifinite measure and $\mu(E) = \infty$, then for any $C > 0$ there exists $F \subset E$ with $C < \mu(F) < \infty$.

*Proof*. Because $\mu$ is semifinite, for any $E \in \sM$ such that $\mu(E) = \infty$ the set $$\sF = \{ F \subset E : F \text{ measurable and } 0 < \mu(F) < \mu(E)\}$$ is non-empty. So choose an arbitrary $E \in \sM$. Now consider $k = \sup_{F \in \sF} \mu(F)$. If $k = \infty$ the claim follows, because we would have, for all $C > 0$, some set $B \in \sF$ such that $\mu(B) > 0$. We therefore will suppose $k < \infty$ and proceed to find a sequence $\{F_i\}_1^\infty \subset \sF$ such that $\mu(\cup_1^\infty F_i) = \infty$.

For contradiction, suppose $k < \infty$ and there's no sequence $\{F_i\}$ in $\sF$ with $\mu(\cup F_i) = \infty$. By additivity, $\mu(\cup F_i) + \mu(E \setminus \cup F_i) = \mu(E) = \infty$. We've assumed $\mu(F_i) < \infty$, so for the previous equality to hold we must have $\mu(E \setminus \cup F_i) = \infty$. Because $\mu$ is semifinite, there's a set $G \in \sM$ such that $G \subset (E \setminus \cup F_i)$ and $0 < \mu(G) < \infty$.

Now $G \sqcup (\cup F_i) \in \sF$


### Semifinite parts [@Fo99, number 2.15]

If $\mu$ is a measure on $(X, \sM)$, define $\mu_0$ on $\sM$ for each $E \subset X$ by $$\mu_0(E) = \sup\{\mu(F) : F \subset E \text{ and } \mu(F) \le \infty\}.$$

(a) $\mu_0$ is a semifinite measure.^[It's called the **semifinite part** of $\mu$.]
(b) If $\mu$ is semifinite, then $\mu_0 = \mu$.

### Countable additivity for intersections in outer measures [@Fo99, number 2.17]

If $\mu^*$ is an outer measure and $\{A_j\}_1^\infty$ is a sequence of disjoint $\mu^*$-measurable sets, then $\mu^*(E \cap (\cup_1^\infty A_j)) = \sum_1^\infty \mu^*(E\cap A_j)$ for any $E \subset X$.

### [@Fo99, number 2.18]

Let $\sA \subset \sP(X)$ be an algebra, $\sA_\sigma$ the collection of countable unions of sets in $\sA$, and $\sA_{\sigma\delta}$ the collection of countable intersections of sets in $\sA_\sigma$. Let $\mu$ be a premeasure on $\sA$ and $\mu^*$ the induced outer measure.

(a) For any $E \subset X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $A \in \sA_\sigma$ with $E \subset A$ and $\mu^*(A) \le \mu^*(E) + \epsilon$.
(b) If $\mu^*(E) < \infty$, then $E$ is $\mu^*$ measurable iff there exists $B \in \sA_{ \sigma\delta }$ with $E \subset B$ and $\mu^*(B\setminus E) = 0$.
(c) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, the restriction $\mu^*(E) <\infty$ in (b) is superfluous.

### [@Fo99, number 2.19]

Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on $X$ induced from a premeasure, such that $\mu^*(X) < \infty$. If $E \subset X$, define the inner measure of $E$ to be $\mu_*(E) = \mu^*(X) - \mu^*(E^c)$. Then $E$ is $\mu^*$-measurable iff $\mu^*(E) = \mu_*(E)$.

### [@Fo99, number 2.22]

Let $(X, \sM, \mu)$ be a measure space, $\mu^*$ the outer measure induced by $\mu$ according to $$\mu^*(E) = \inf\left\{\sum_1^\infty\mu(A_j): A_j \in \sA, E \subset \bigcup_1^\infty A_j\right\},$$ and $\sM^*$ the $\sigma$-algebra of $\mu^*$-measurable sets, and $\tilde{\mu} = \mu^* | \sM^*$.

(a) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then $\tilde{\mu}$ is the completion of $\mu$.

### [@Fo99, number 2.23]

Let $\sA$ be the collection of finite unions of sets of the form $(a,b] \cap \QQ$ with $-\infty \le a\le b \le \infty$. 

(a) Knowing "if $\sE$ is an elementary family, the collection $\sA$ of finite disjoint unions of members of $\sE$ is an algebra" we have that $\sA$ is an algebra of $\QQ$.

### Closure under countable increasing unions [@Fo99, number 1.4]

An algebra $\sA$ is an $\sigma$-algebra iff $\sA$ is closed under countable increasing unions.
That is, $$\text{if } \{E_j\}_1^\infty \subset \sA \text{ and } E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \cdots, \text{ then } \cup_1^\infty \in \sA.$$

### Linear combinations of measures [@Fo99, number 1.7]

If $\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_n$ are measures on $(X, \sM)$ and $a_1, \ldots,a_n \in [0,\infty)$, then $\sum_1^n a_j \mu_j$ is a measure on $(X,\mu)$.

### Summing sets by union and intersection [@Fo99, number 1.9]

If $(X, \sM, \mu)$ is a measure space and $E, F \in \sM$, then $$\mu(E) + \mu(F) = \mu(E\cup F) + \mu(E\cap F).$$

### A measure relative to set intersection [@Fo99, number 1.10]

If $(X, \sM, \mu)$ is a measure space and $E \in \sM$, define $$\mu_E(A) = \mu(A \cap E) \text{ for all } A \in \sM.$$
Then $\mu_E$ is a measure.
